# Sadia Fathima – Data Scientist & Developer  
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m an undergraduate Data Science major at UC Davis, passionate about building real-world ML systems and data-driven products. This repo houses the code, documentation, and data pipelines that power my portfolio site:

##  Featured Projects  

### Capture App – AI-Driven Scrapbook Generator (Founder)  
A mobile app that converts photo libraries into personalized scrapbooks with deep learning pipelines. Engineered feature extraction and clustering on over 10,000 images for student adoption projections.  

### Fake Data Generator
Developed a Streamlit app for generating customizable mock datasets using Pandas. Enables rapid prototyping and testing in data science workflows without compromising sensitive data.

### MLP Model
Implemented and evaluated a multiple linear regression model in R to predict active physicians in 1990. Produced visual insights with ggplot2 and conducted exploratory data analysis to validate findings.

### Emotion Recognition & Risk Assessment  
Implemented a dual-stage model using MobileNetV2 and Random Forest to detect emotional cues and flag at-risk users—evaluated using F1 and ROC-AUC metrics.  

### Customer Retention Analytics Dashboard  
Built data workflows in SQL and Python and visualized user retention patterns using Power BI and Plotly dashboards. Outcome: provided insights that supported targeted retention strategies.  

### Low-Bandwidth Super-Resolution  
Benchmarked image super-resolution models (SRGAN, ESRGAN, Transformers, Diffusion) for low-bitrate deployments. Achieved PSNR 27.0 dB, SSIM 0.82 via a lightweight hybrid model running under 50 ms/frame on mobile NPUs.
